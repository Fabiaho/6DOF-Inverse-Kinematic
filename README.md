# Project 3: Learning the inverse kinematics
## Short Description
In robotics, calculating the TCPâ€™s position from joint positions (forward kinematics) is often
straightforward, using methods such as the Denavit-Hartenberg transformation. However, the
inverse problem (calculating joint angles for a desired TCP pose) is generally more complex,
especially for robots with three or more joints, and usually lacks a closed-form solution. In this
project, you will approach inverse kinematics using machine learning, which offers flexibility for
approximating this relationship without needing explicit mathematical models.
